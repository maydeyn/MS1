      <h3>Question</h3>
      How to create an immersive, unique yet educational experience about vision impairment for young adults?
    </div>
    <div id="b2">
      <h3>Conceptualization</h3>

      Inspired by the concept of <a
        href="http://henryjenkins.org/blog/2007/03/transmedia_storytelling_101.html">Transmedia Storytelling</a> -
      telling the same story in different forms that eventually
      emerge and become a whole and unique experience. I wanted to explore this concept with my research question by
      connecting physical and digital media.
      I believe this technique would be appealing to young adults since it encourages the use of multiple senses,
      technologies, and media all at once, letting the audiences to be explorative.
      <br>
      Keywords: exploration, collaboration, senses, immersive, experience, interactive

      <h3>Development</h3>
      This two-person interactive experience will be conducted in a park. The goal is to navigate through and
      eventually exit the park. Your friend can help you by
      giving you hints related to smell or sound. However, you may not give any sort of directional guidance (left,
      right, clock position, etc). <u>You have to complete this experience relying on your auditory and olfactory
        senses.</u>

      <br>
      <ol>The prototype will include three parts:
        <li><a href="https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/frames.html">Bose AR Audio sunglasses</a>
          It resembles the look and feel of regular sunglasses. However, it does have audio support that allow you to
          communicate with others through the device.</li>
        <li>Various types of vision filters. The user will not be able to see anything clearly but will still have light
          perception (simulating legally blind).</li>
        <li>A friend!</li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <u><b>IMPORTANT RULES</b></u>
        <li>
          No directional guidance!
        </li>
        <li>
          No physical contacts!
        </li>

      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="d4">
      <h3>Outcome</h3>
      <img src="public/image/finalproject/samplemap.jpg" width="400" height="550" class="center">
      This is a simple outlined map of the park that labeled a few types of noises that exist within the park. It also
      indicates the starting and endpoint, so you can plan your route as you guide your friend through the park.
      <br>
      A total of 4 teams will start at the same time, and whichever team exits the park first wins.
      <br>
      At the end of the activity, people can share what helped them navigated through the park, was it sensory? Or was
      it helpful hints from the guidance friend? Now reverse the roles and go through the experiences again. Was it
      easier this time around?
      <br>

    </div>
    <div id="e5">
      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      I think the activity by itself is an interesting <u>collaborative interaction that involves problem-solving and
        reflection</u>. The objective of this activity is to make people become aware that vision impairment may
      seem
      like an extreme inconvenient at first, but you will eventually realize that when your other senses have been
      highlighted, you can operate just as fine. This activity is sought to help reduce false sympathy towards the
      vision impaired population.
