            <h3>Feedback & Reflection</h3>
            <h4>Research Question</h4>
            One of the most critical steps to take my project to the next level
            is to refine the language of my research question.
            <b
              >"How to educate people with normal vision about vision
              impairment?"</b
            >
            is an extensive question. While it offers a lot of different
            solutions and possibilities, it is quite impossible to pinpoint what
            exactly I want to achieve through my project. There are three
            aspects of this problem that I seek to specify:
            <ul>
              <li><b>Audiences</b>: Who am I trying to educate? Why them?</li>
              <li>
                <b>Educate</b>: How do I want to educate them? Through what
                media? What do I wish to teach them about? Is it about raising
                awareness and the prevention of vision impairment, or am I
                aiming to reduce the misconception, false sympathy, stereotypes,
                and lack of understanding of the vision-impaired population?
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Vision impairment</b>: There are so many types of vision
                impairments out there, which type am I focusing on? Why that one
                particularly? Based on the precedents, it seems like many of
                them focuses on complete blindness or color blind. However, I
                think it is important to note that many people suffering from
                vision loss experiences multiple types of vision impairment.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
              “Being creative is often like being a blind person. We are dealing
              with a problem that we cannot see. We talk about it, we look at
              it, and then we try to solve it understanding only the parts that
              we can see. The problem is that we can get in a rut and start
              seeing the same problem and offering the same solution.”

            This quote really made me think about the ways I should refine my
            question - how to approach this topic without only tackling at the
            surface level? If I am aiming to reduce the stereotypes, false
            sympathy, or prejudices towards the vision impaired population, how
            can I make sure I can avoid these altogether during the process?
            With these questions in mind, I have generated some approaches to my
            research question as well as a potential specific question:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Speak to blind people, engage the vision impaired population as
                much as possible.
              </li>
              <li>
                How to reduce false sympathy, stereotypes, and ignorance towards
                blindness?
              </li>
              <li>How to raise awareness and educate users about glaucoma?</li>
              <li>
                How to educate users about the prevention of Age-Related Macular
                Degeneration, the leading cause of impairment of reading for the
                elderlies?
              </li>
            </ul>

            This diagram consists of the qualities I appreciated from the
            precedents I looked into. While trying to create a balance between
            accessibility, immersive and interactiveness, I would like to put an
            emphasis on the educational aspect. Looking at the precedents there
            are some patterns I’ve noticed:
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li><b> Educational, but not accessible:</b></li>
              Real-world experiences such as Dialogue in the Dark or Dark Dining
              can be very educational since it provides direct interaction with
              vision impaired population and limited vision environment.
              However, it is a very limited form due to its requirement of being
              present physically.
              <br />
              <li><b> Education, but not so fun:</b></li>
              Usually does not generate interest for people with normal vision,
              only people who are working in the field that relates to or
              includes vision-impaired population would use these tools. Fun,
              but negative connotation; Most games that involve limited vision
              are always related to horror, thriller or mystery. Even though
              games are appealing to normal vision population, is there a way to
              incorporate educational elements?
              <br />
              <li><b>Fun AND Educational:</b></li>
              I realized
              <u>colorblindness</u>
              finds great success in terms of balancing both fun and educational
              aspect while researching precedents. There are various forms of
              games that is related to colorblindness are extremely educational
              but also allows player interaction. I believe color blind is one
              of the easier vision impairment that can be directly visualized
              digitally with higher accuracy. The technology can easily simulate
              the challenges of people with colorblindness may face in their
              lives. It is also a type of vision impairment that does not
              necessarily involve complete vision loss, therefore it is easily
              to visualize it digitally.
            </ul>
            <br />
            <b>“Games are only effective if people play them”</b>
            <br />
            One of the feedback I have received from the critics made me realize
            a loophole in my research question. If my end goal is to educate the
            seeing population,
            <u
              >how do I attract this population of normal vision in the first
              place?</u
            >
            I only found out about these precedents because I intended to work
            with vision impairment. Most people with normal vision would not
            take the initiative to engage a topic like this. Then, I remembered
            my experience with Dialogue in the Dark: I had no idea what it was
            about but it sounded interesting and exciting. I believe a huge part
            of making a successful project in this context is to create some
            sort of mystery that would ignite audiences’ curiosity and allow
            them to be explorative.
