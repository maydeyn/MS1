                    <h3>Reflection of the Semester</h3>
                    <p><u>What are the specific questions you are attempting to answer in your prototypes?</u>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How to make the medical procedures and process less intimidating for the general public?
                            </li>
                            <li>How to repurpose a medical procedure (an eye exam) that creates a non-invasive
                                environment and encourages self-exploration, but still follow the process structure of
                                an eye exam? </li>
                            <li>Can the repurposed interaction that mimics an eye exam be further developed into a
                                project that may promote better experiences for patients visiting optometrists?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><u>What the five strengths of your project?</u>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The <b>uniqueness</b> in terms of the concept and form, repurposing medical
                                devices, diagnosis process, and medical language into a playful interaction with the
                                user itself and poetry.</li>
                            <li>The <b>aesthetic</b> of the phoropter is eye-catching and generates a lot of initial
                                interest
                                from audiences.</li>
                            <li>The use of <b>Poetry</b> gives audiences room for interpretation and imagination.</li>
                            <li><b>Self-exploratory interactions</b></li>
                            <li><b>Non-invasive environment</b></li>

                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><u>What are the five most critical issues for your project?</u>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Clarity on the interactive process</li>
                            <li>Meaning behind the poetry and how it is being generated?</li>
                            <li>What is being tracked through users' eyes?</li>
                            <li>Where can this installation be implemented to achieve my goal?</li>
                            <li>Incorporate more unique results for each individual</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><u>What can you do to address these issues, and to solidify the strengths?</u>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Implementing technology that can identify emotions through eyes and facial expressions,
                                then generate a poem based on the mood. This will clarify the diagnosis process.</li>
                            <li>Add an instructional interface for the users when they look into the phoropter to
                                explain the interaction process. </li>
                            <li>Add a more sophisticated poetry API to generate appropriate poetry that matches users’
                                moods instead of AI-generated poems that may turn out gibberish. </li>
                            <li>Optometry schools, optometrists offices or hospitals may be appropriate locations for
                                this installation. More scouting needs to be conducted.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><u>What new questions do you have?</u>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Is it possible to breakdown the medical language into a more approachable language for
                                the general public? </li>
                            <li>Does everyone have negative experiences or feel intimidated by the medical procedures?
                            </li>
                            <li>How do medical professionals feel when they interact with my project? Does the process
                                make sense to them?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><u>What questions need to be answered in order to create a proof of concept prototype?</u>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How do the audience feel after the self-diagnosis process?</li>
                            <li>Does this resonates with people who have not visited an optometrist/used a phoropter/had
                                an eye exam before? </li>
                            <li>Does the set up of AEye Poet reminds the audience of medical experiences or
                                environment?</li>
                            <li>How do the audience respond to the poetry they receive? How do they interpret it?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><u>How has this prototype allowed you to engage in your goals within this program? Does this feel
                            like a possible future direction?</u>
                        <ul>
                            This project is definitely something I’ve never done before. The implementation of new
                            technologies that I am unfamiliar with and the process of connecting physical computing with
                            real-time data was fun and challenging. I think this project can be developed into a much
                            more
                            sophisticated installation in the future. The current prototype feels like a scratch on the
                            surface for what my goal is and I hope to develop this AEye Poet to a more complete and
                            standalone project, and perhaps extend this concept into a series of work.
