      <h3>Question</h3>
      How to reduce false sympathy and lack of understanding of people with disabilities?
    </div>
    <div id="b2">
      <h3>Conceptualization</h3>
      One of my favorite experience of learning about other people’s stories was through an exhibition called <a
        href="https://brokenships.com/explore">Museum of Broken Relationships</a>:
      <blockquote>It is a physical and virtual public space created with the sole purpose of treasuring and sharing your
        heartbreak stories and symbolic possessions.
        It is a museum about you, about us, about the ways we love and lose. At its core, the Museum is an ever-growing
        collection of items, each a memento of a relationship past, accompanied by a personal, yet anonymous story of
        its contributor. Unlike ‘destructive’ self-help instructions for recovery from grief and loss, the Museum offers
        the chance to overcome an emotional collapse through creativity - by contributing to its universal collection.”
      </blockquote>

    <div id="c3">
      <h3>Development</h3>
      “I Wish They Knew” is a disabled community-driven museum space that exists in both physical and virtual space. It
      accepts objects with a personal story from all around the world anonymously. They can share anything - their pain
      and struggles; their inspirational stories; their moment of clarity - anything that they wish someone else knew
      about them, during the journey of life with disability.

      <h3>Outcome</h3>
      <img src="public/image/finalproject/I wish you knew museum.gif" class="center">
      <br>
      I used SketchUp to create a quick a museum space that will display the objects that has been sent. As you can see
      there is no limitation on what type of objects that can be put on display, as long as there is no personal
      information or photographs. Each object will have a label that indicates the name of the object, date of when the
      story occurred, and the story. It will also be available as audio.
    </div>
    <div id="e5">
      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      What I liked about this prototype:
      <li>Community-driven project, you can hear different stories from people all around the world</li>
      <li>People can make emotional connections, be more understanding and replace sympathy with empathy.</li>

      Issues/future development:
      <li>Limited to English languages. Perhaps have translation services. </li>
      <li>May take a long time to build up the project, including the selection process.</li>
      <li>How often should the objects be updated?</li>
      </ul>
