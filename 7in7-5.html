      <h3>Question</h3>
      How to reduce false sympathy and lack of understanding of people with disabilities?
    </div>
    <div id="b2">
      <h3>Conceptualization</h3>
      One of my favorite experience of learning about other people’s stories was through an exhibition called <a
        href="https://brokenships.com/explore">Museum of Broken Relationships</a>:
      <blockquote>It is a physical and virtual public space created with the sole purpose of treasuring and sharing your
        heartbreak stories and symbolic possessions.
        It is a museum about you, about us, about the ways we love and lose. At its core, the Museum is an ever-growing
        collection of items, each a memento of a relationship past, accompanied by a personal, yet anonymous story of
        its contributor. Unlike ‘destructive’ self-help instructions for recovery from grief and loss, the Museum offers
        the chance to overcome an emotional collapse through creativity - by contributing to its universal collection.”
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Development</h3>
      “I Wish They Knew” is a disabled community-driven museum space that accepts donations from all around the world to
      send an object with a personal story anonymously. They can share anything - their pain and struggles; sharing
      their inspirational stories; their moment of clarity - anything that they wish someone else knew about them,
      during the journey of life with disability.
