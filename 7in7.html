      <h3>Question</h3>
      How to engage the population of normal vision, and educate them about
      vision impairment?
    </div>
    <div id="b2">
      <h3>Conceptualization</h3>
      There are many amazing and accessible vision impairment simulation
      tools, however, most of them are only being used by designers, educators
      or others that are working with vision impaired population.
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          Access of <u>platforms</u> that are being used by people with normal
          vision primarily.
        </li>

        <li>
          Surprise them! Most people usually wouldn’t engage topics that do
          not generate interest to them.
        </li>

        <li>
          When people are scrolling through the filters to apply to their
          photos, they will be puzzled at first about the weird, unpleasant
          and discolored filters, but soon people will realize that it’s a
          “simulation” of various vision impairment.
        </li>
      </ul>

      A collaboration with Instagram on World Vision Day:
      <u>what does your life look like in other people’s eyes?</u>
      <br>
      Keywords: raise awareness, educational, accessible
    </div>
    <div id="c3">
      <h3>Development</h3>
      Taking the current Instagram user interface, all filters will be replaced by the simulations of various types of
      vision impairments.

        <figcaption>Original Instagram User Interface, Oct 2019</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <b>Features</b>
        <li>User can adjust the intensity of the simulation filters</li>
        <li> Data display: you can see how many people on Instagram has posted photos using the filter, and how many
          people on
          earth are affected by that specific visual impairment</li>
        <li>Learn more about the type of vision impairment by clicking on the filtered photo. </li>
        <li>Option to donate to your local vision impairment charities by using the filters.</li>

      </ul>
      I also made sure each filter has a name that isn’t related to vision impairment; I believe this is an
      important step to ensure the element of surprise to the users and sparks curiosity.

      <h3>Outcome</h3>
      <img src="public/image/finalproject/filters.gif" width="330" height="600" class="center">
      You wake up, pick up your phone and opens up Instagram just as usual.
      <br>
      You start to notice something different about the photos you are seeing. They look kind of odd, weird. <br>
      You wonder what is going on, you start to navigate through Instagram and found out the Instagram filters look
      different from what you remembered.
      <br>
      You picked a photo, and started to apply different filters. After you post a photo with Aura filter, you realized
      the odd, overly intense halo and glare filter is actually a simulation of this visual impairment.
      <br>
      You post the photo, you start to wonder, how many people have these “crazy filters” in real life that they have to
      deal with on a daily basis?
      <br>
      You wanted to learn more about halo and glare.

    </div>
    <div id="e5">
      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      It was an effective way in my mind to reach a large amount of population from different background and culture in
      a short period of time. I believe it is capable of creating chain reactions/domino effects that just gets bigger
      like a snowball.
      I also feel this concept can be applied to other projects with similar purposes in the future.
