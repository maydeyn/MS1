            <h3>Why Bryant Park?</h3>
            <p> Bryant Park is one of the few parks that are mostly enjoyed by local New Yorkers. Being surrounded
                by
                many office buildings, schools, and New York Public Library, you can find many students and young
                professionals hanging out at the park. However, the park is also a great place for kids and the
                elderly.
                Throughout the year Bryant Park hosts various activities including sports tournaments, painting
                sessions, dancing classes and much more. <b>Bryant Park is a condensed epitome of New York
                    itself</b>:
                people
                from all different age groups, cultures and backgrounds exist harmoniously all in one place.

            <p>After walking around the park and observing all the different activities, we came to this realization
                that - while Bryant Park is able to bring all different kinds of people together, they rarely
                interact
                with one another - there isn't much reason to. We'd like to give them a reason.</p>
