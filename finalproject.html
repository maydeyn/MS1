        <h3>Observation 1: Real World Experience - Dialogue in the Darkness</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Location: Shenzhen, China</li>
          <li>Date: 06/16/2019</li>
          <li>Time: 7:00-8:30pm</li>
        </ul>
        <p id="indent">
          In the summer of 2019, I stumbled upon a place called Dialogue in the
          Dark with my friend in Shenzhen when we were looking for interesting
          activities to go to. We did not know any details about this exhibition
          tour besides that it involves darkness. The fact that we went through
          this whole tour without much knowledge was crucial and it has made a
          huge impact on our experience. <br />
        </p>

        <p id="indent">
          There are 7 of us going through this experience together, we were
          greeted by a guide as soon as we stepped into the exhibition.
          Throughout the process, we had to learn how to handle daily life
          routines and navigate in daily environments in completely dark
          environment while interacting with strangers. It gets awhile to get
          used to, not just to adjust ourselves with darkness but also learning
          to identify the world through other senses, and to build trust with
          others. At first, I felt this experience makes me realize how much I
          appreciate my vision. However, as I spent more time in the darkness, I
          feel like I wasn’t any “weaker” without my vision, I was able to
          utilize my other senses and engage with others.
        </p>
        <p id="indent">
          Towards the end of the tour, we sat down at a table and the guide
          asked if we had any questions. It wasn’t until then that I found out
          that our guide was blind. Everyone in the group thought he had a night
          vision goggles on, not only because he was familiar with the
          environment (which makes sense since he works there) but he was also
          able to tell our actions and positions in the darkness. He still has
          some perception of light but is unable to see anything clearly at all.
          <br />

        <p id="indent">
          Dialogue in the Dark was a very unique experience for me - I went in
          “blind” - without any knowledge about this exhibition. It has educated
          and raised my awareness for diversity and inclusion for the vision
          impaired people.

            >The experience helps us to overcome false sympathy, prejudices and
            stereotypes. In “Darkness” Interest replaces ignorance, and lack of
            understanding changes into empathy.”
